This project provides an editor for 
(iced-coffeescript)[http://coffeescript.org/], using the 
(Xtext)[http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/] toolkit.

Installation:

Help -> Install Software
Add update site: http://rjpower.org/iced-eclipse/
Install IcedCoffeeScript

By default, the editor will be registered for the \*.coffee and \*.iced 
file types.

It currently just adds simple highlighting support, but I plan to add more 
extensive support for cross-referencing and outlining as time permits.
